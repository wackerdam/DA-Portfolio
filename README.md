# DA-Portfolio
This is a portfolio that showcases everything that I have learned so far in regards to general coding and data-analytics during my final year of college.
I will attempt to showcase my skills through things that I'm generally interested in. This can include trading card markets, basic machine learning and 
other miscellaneous stuff. This repository is made in tandem with a seperate portfolio that is also being made on DCU Loop Reflect. DCU Loop Reflect is
a tool for students that can be used to make portfolios and other things.
